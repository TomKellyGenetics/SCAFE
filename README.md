*SCAFE* (Single Cell Analysis of Five-prime Ends) provides an end-to-end solution for processing of single cell 5’end RNA-seq data. It takes a read alignment file (**.bam*) from single-cell RNA-5’end-sequencing (e.g. 10xGenomics Chromimum®), precisely maps the cDNA 5'ends (i.e. transcription start sites, TSS), filters for the artefacts and identifies genuine TSS clusters using logistic regression. Based on the TSS clusters, it defines transcribed cis-regulatory elements (tCRE) and annotated them to gene models. It then counts the UMI in tCRE in single cells and returns a tCRE UMI/cellbarcode matrix ready for downstream analyses, e.g. cell-type clustering, linking promoters to enhancers
*etc* .

### *SCAFE* extracts transcribed cis-regulatory elements from single-cell RNA-5’end-sequencing data
Profiling of cis-regulatory elements (CREs, mostly promoters and enhancers) in single cells allows us to interrogate the cell-type specific contexts of gene regulation and genetic predisposition to diseases. Single-cell RNA-5’end-sequencing methods (sc-end5-seq, available from [10xGenomics Chromimum®](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000939852-What-is-the-difference-between-Single-Cell-3-and-5-Gene-Expression-libraries-)) theorectically captures the 5'end of cDNA, which represents transcription start sites (TSS). Measuring the RNA output at TSS allows us to precisely locate transcribed CREs (tCREs) on the genome, enabling the quantification of promoter and enhancer activities in single cells. **Figure (a)** shows the sc-end5-seq signal at the two promoters of gene *DHX30*. It highlights the consistency between sc-end5-seq and sc-ATAC-seq data, as well as the dynamic alternaitve TSS usage between cell states (i.e. resting and stimulated immune cells). *SCAFE* identify genuine TSS information from sc-end5-seq data. **Figure (b)** illustrates the stretagies of SCAFE to defined tCRE from TSS information. **Figure (c)** shows the proximal and distal tCREs defined by *SCAFE* at *PTGER4* locus. **Figure (d)** shows the activities of the proximal and distal tCREs at *PTGER4* locus in resting and simulated immune cells, demonstarting the capability of *SCAFE* to study CRE activities in single cells.

## How does *SCAFE* do it?
<div style="text-align:center"><img src=".github/images/flowchart.png?" width="860"></div>

### *SCAFE* Core Tools and Workflows
*SCAFE* consists of [a set of perl programs](scripts/) for processing of sc-end5-seq data. Major tools are listed in **Figure (a)**. *SCAFE* accepts read alignment in *\*.bam* format from 10xGenomics Chromimum® software *cellranger*. Tool ***bam\_to\_ctss*** extracts the 5’ position of reads, taking the 5’ unencoded-Gs into account. Tool ***remove\_strand\_invader*** removes read 5’ends that are strand invasion artifacts by aligning the TS oligo sequence to the immediate upstream sequence of the read 5’end. Tool *cluster* performs clustering of read 5’ends using 3rd-party tool *Paraclu*. Tool ***filter*** extracts the properties of TSS clusters and performs multiple logistic regression to distinguish genuine TSS clusters from artifacts. Tool ***annotate*** define tCREs by merging closely located TSS clusters and annotate tCREs based on their proximity to known genes. Tool ***count*** counts the number of UMI within each tCRE in single cells and generates a tCRE-Cell UMI count matrix. SCAFE tools were also implemented workflows for processing of individual samples or pooling of multiple samples.

*P.S.* *SCAFE* also accepts bulk 5'end RNA-Seq data (e.g. bulk CAGE). See [scripts](scripts/) for details.

### *SCAFE* discovers *de novo* genunie TSS clusters and tCREs
A fraction of TSS identified based on read 5′ends from template switching (TS) reactions (used in 10xGenomics Chromimum®) may not be genuine, attributed to various artefacts including strand invasion and other sources. This results in excessive artifactual TSS misidentified along the gene body, collectively known as “exon painting”. While strand invasion artefacts can be specifically minimized by considering the complementarity of TSS upstream sequence to TS oligo sequence, a non-negligible fraction of artefactual TSS remains after filtering for strand invasion. To minimize the artifactual TSS, *SCAFE* examines the properties of TSS clusters, as shown in **Figure (b)**, and devised a classifier to identify genuine TSS based on multiple logistic regression. This classifier, i.e. logistic probability, achieved excellent performance with AUC>0.98 across sequencing depths and outperformed all individual metrics. This is implemented in the tool ***filter***.

## Dependencies
### perl
*SCAFE* is mainly written in perl (v5.24.1 or later). All scripts are standalone applications and **DO NOT require installations** of extra perl modules. Check whether perl is properly installed on your system.

Successful for all checks. SCAFE should run well.
```
### Docker image
If you have docker installed on your system, you might also consider loading *SCAFE* as a docker image

```shell
#---load the docker image (Not implemented yet)
./scripts/XXX.XXX.XXX
```

## Getting started with demo data
Now you have enssured all dependencies and downloaded SCAFE, time to get the demo data and test a few runs on the demo data.

### Download demo data and reference genome
Demo data and reference genome must be downloaded for testing *SCAFE* on your system.

```shell
#--- download the demo data using script download.demo.input
./scripts/download.demo.input
	
#--- download the reference genome hg19.gencode_v32lift37 for testing demo data
./scripts/download.resources.genome --genome=hg19.gencode_v32lift37
```

### Test run a single cell solo workflow for demo data
Now, let's test *SCAFE* with a workflow (*workflow.sc.solo*) that processes one library of single cell 5'end RNA-seq data. First we check out the help message of *workflow.sc.solo*. Remember you can always check the help message for all scripts of *SCAFE* using the *--help* flag. 

```shell
#--- check out the help message of workflow.sc.solo
./scripts/workflow.sc.solo --help
```
It should print the help message as the followings:

```shell

```

The help message details the input options, noted some are ***\<required\>*** and ***(optional)***. *workflow.sc.solo* takes a bam file (*--run\_bam\_path=*), a cellbarcode list file (*--run\_cellbarcode\_path=*), the corresponding reference genome (*--genome=*) and the output prefix (*--run_tag=*) and directory (*--run_outDir=*). At the end of the message, it also prints the commands for running the script on demo data. Now, copy the command and run as the following:

```shell
#--- run the workflow on the demo.cellranger.bam, it'll take a couple of minutes 
./scripts/workflow.sc.solo \
--overwrite=yes \
--run_bam_path=./demo/input/sc.solo/demo.cellranger.bam \
--run_cellbarcode_path=./demo/input/sc.solo/demo.barcodes.tsv.gz \
--genome=hg19.gencode_v32lift37 \
--run_tag=demo \
--run_outDir=./demo/output/sc.solo/
```

If it finishes smoothly, you should see the following message on screen:

```shell
 #=====================================================
 Results of all tasks found. All tasks run successfully
 #=====================================================
```

You can also check out some of the outputs: 

```shell
#--- check the output of tCRE annotation tables
ls -alh ./demo/output/sc.solo/annotate/demo/log

#--- check the output of tCRE UMI count matrix
ls -alh ./demo/output/sc.solo/count/demo/matrix
```

### Test run all workflows on bulk and single cell data
Finally, we recommended a test run for all 6 available workflows on the demo data. It will take around ~20 minutes on a regular system running at 5 threads (default).

```shell
#--- check out the help message of demo.test.run
./scripts/demo.test.run --help

#--- run the all six available workflows on the demo bulk and single
#--- it'll take a around 20 minutes
./scripts/demo.test.run \
--overwrite=yes \
--run_outDir=./demo/output/

## Run *SCAFE* on your own data 

### Input *\*.bam* files
*SCAFE* maps the cDNA 5'end by identifying the junction between the TS oligo and the cDNA on **Read 1** of sc-end5-seq data on the 10xGenomics Chromimum® platform. Therefore, **Read 1** must be sequenced long enough (e.g. >50nt) to allow mappnig to genome. The *\*.bam* files are commonly generated from 10xGenomics Chromimum® *cellranger count* pipeline. When running [*cellranger count*](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/count), the *--chemistry*  option must be *SC5P-PE* (Pair-end). The *\*.bam* generated from both *--chemistry fiveprime* and *--chemistry SC5P-R2* options are **NOT COMPATIBLE** with *SCAFE* as the former will remove the junction between the TS oligo and the cDNA on Read 1 and the latter does not even contain Read 1. If users sequecnced Read 1 only, they could run [*cellranger count*](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/count) with *--chemistry SC5P-PE* option by supplying *cellranger* a *dummy* Read 2 fastq with Read 1 reverse complemented. If users wish to generate their own *\*.bam* from other custom pipelines, make sure that:

1. the UMI and cellbarcode information must be present in the *\*.bam* file as custom tags CB:Z and UB:Z respectively, in this order.
2. TS oligo sequence must keep intact on Read 1.

### Run *SCAFE* workflows on single cell data with default options

We recommend most users to run *SCAFE* using workflows with default options. There are 3 types of workflow: **(1)** "***solo***" for processing of a single library, **(2)** "***pool***" for pooling of multiple libraries and **(3)** "***subsample***" for down-sampling a single library (for assessment of sequencing depth). "***solo***" accepts *\*.bam* while "***pool***"/"***subsample***" accepts *\*.ctss.bed* files (generated from *tool.sc.bam\_to\_ctss*). For multiple libraries, we recommend users to first run either *workflow.sc.solo* or *tool.sc.bam\_to\_ctss* on indiviudal libraries, and then take the *\*.ctss.bed* file from all libraries to run *workflow.sc.pool*. Pooling of libraries for defining tCRE is recommended because **(1)** it generally increases the sensitivity of tCRE detection and **(2)** it produces a common set of tCREs for all libraries so the IDs are portable between libraries. Please check the help messages for details of running the workflows: 

```shell
#--- check out the help message of the three single cell workflows
./scripts/workflow.sc.solo --help
./scripts/workflow.sc.pool --help
./scripts/workflow.sc.subsample --help

```
### Run *SCAFE* individual tools with custom options 
For the sake of flexibiity, *SCAFE* allows users to run individual tools with custom options for exploring the effect of cutoffs or supplying alternative intermediate inputs. See [here](scripts/) for the full list of tools and their usage. Let's walk through  a couple of individual tools with the demo data.

* ***tool.sc.bam\_to\_ctss***: First, we convert a cellranger *\*.bam* file to *\*.ctss.bed* files. "ctss" refers as capped TSS, and *\*.ctss.bed* file is a common format for storing TSS information. For procedural convenenice, *tool.sc.bam\_to\_ctss* generates multiple *\*.ctss.bed* files at various levels of collapsing the signal (e.g. piling up UMI at TSS or not, summing up UMI of different cellbarcode or not). By default, the *tool.sc.bam\_to\_ctss* process **ONLY** primary alignments regardless of MAPQ. If users wants to, for example, include also secondary aligments with a minimum MAPQ (e.g. 10), the user could run as the followings:

```shell
#--- check out the help message of tool.sc.bam_to_ctss
./scripts/tool.sc.bam_to_ctss --help

#--- run tool.sc.bam_to_ctss with custom options
./scripts/tool.sc.bam_to_ctss \
--min_MAPQ 10 \
--exclude_flag '128,4' \
--overwrite=yes \
--bamPath=./demo/input/sc.solo/demo.cellranger.bam \
--genome=hg19.gencode_v32lift37 \
--outputPrefix=demo \
--outDir=./demo/output/sc.solo/bam_to_ctss/
```
* ***tool.cm.remove\_strand\_invader***: Then, we removes the strand invader artefacts from the *\*.ctss.bed* file generated from  *tool.sc.bam\_to\_ctss*. Please refer to [here](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/41/3/e44/2902349) for the rationale of removing strand invader artefacts. If the users would like to use a more stringent cutoff to define strand invader artefacts, e.g. --min\_edit\_distance=3 and --min\_end\_non\_G\_num=1, so that less reads will be removed, and the user could run as the followings: 

```shell
#--- check out the help message of tool.cm.remove_strand_invader
./scripts/tool.cm.remove_strand_invader --help

#--- run tool.cm.remove_strand_invader with custom options
./scripts/tool.cm.remove_strand_invader \
--min_edit_distance=3 \
--min_end_non_G_num=1 \
--overwrite=yes \
--ctss_bed_path=./demo/output/sc.solo/bam_to_ctss/demo/bed/demo.collapse.ctss.bed.gz \
--genome=hg19.gencode_v32lift37 \
--outputPrefix=demo \
--outDir=./demo/output/sc.solo/remove_strand_invader/
```
* ***tool.cm.cluster***: Then, we cluster the *\*.ctss.bed* file into TSS clusters. Please refer to [here](http://cbrc3.cbrc.jp/~martin/paraclu/) for the rationale of clustering. By default, the clusters with <5 UMI within cluster, <3 UMI at summit or expressed in <3 cells were removed. If the users would like to use a more stringent cutoff to remove more lowly expressed TSS clusters, e.g. --min_cluster_count=10, --min_summit_count=5 and --min_num_sample_expr_cluster=5,the user could run as the followings: 

```shell
#--- check out the help message of tool.cm.cluster
./scripts/tool.cm.cluster --help

#--- run tool.cm.cluster with custom options
./scripts/tool.cm.cluster \
--min_cluster_count=10 \
--min_summit_count=5 \
--min_num_sample_expr_cluster=5 \
--overwrite=yes \
--cluster_ctss_bed_path=./demo/output/sc.solo/bam_to_ctss/demo/bed/demo.collapse.ctss.bed.gz \
--outputPrefix=demo \
--outDir=./demo/output/sc.solo/cluster/
```
* ***tool.cm.filter***: Then, we filter the TSS cluster using logistic regression. By default, *tool.cm.filter* uses a pre-trained multiple logistic regression model from human iPSC cells using matched ATAC-Seq data. If the users would like to use their own matched ATAC-Seq data (–logP as *\*.bigwig* file) for training of the regression model using *--training_signal_path* and *--testing_signal_path* options. Also, the user can set a permissive logistic probablity threshold (default=0.5) using *--default_cutoff* option (e.g. 0.3). The user could run as the followings:

```shell
#--- check out the help message of tool.cm.filter
./scripts/tool.cm.filter --help

#--- run tool.cm.cluster with custom options
./scripts/tool.cm.filter \
--default_cutoff=0.3 \
--overwrite=yes \
--ctss_bed_path=./demo/output/sc.solo/bam_to_ctss/demo/bed/demo.collapse.ctss.bed.gz \
--ung_ctss_bed_path=./demo/output/sc.solo/bam_to_ctss/demo/bed/demo.unencoded_G.collapse.ctss.bed.gz \
--tssCluster_bed_path=./demo/output/sc.solo/cluster/demo/bed/demo.tssCluster.bed.gz \
--training_signal_path=./demo/input/atac/demo.atac.bw \
--testing_signal_path=./demo/input/atac/demo.atac.bw \
--genome=hg19.gencode_v32lift37 \
--outputPrefix=demo \
--outDir=./demo/output/sc.solo/filter/
```
* ***tool.cm.annotate***: Finally, we will define and annotate tCREs based on the gene models in reference genome. By default, *tool.cm.annotate* merge TSS clusters located within +100nt and –400nt as a tCRE (defined by combination of option *--CRE_extend_size* and *--CRE_extend_upstrm_ratio*). Also, the tCREs with +/-500nt of annotated gene TSS will be assigned as proximal tCRE (defined by option *--proximity_slop_rng*). If the users would like to define tCRE by merging more distant TSS clusters (e.g. +200nt and –600nt) and assign tCRE further away (+/-1000nt) from gene TSS as proximal, the user could run as the followings:

```shell
#--- check out the help message of tool.cm.annotate
./scripts/tool.cm.annotate --help

#--- run tool.cm.annotate with custom options
./scripts/tool.cm.annotate \
--CRE_extend_size=800 \
--CRE_extend_upstrm_ratio=3 \
--proximity_slop_rng=1000 \
--overwrite=yes \
--tssCluster_bed_path=./demo/output/sc.solo/filter/demo/bed/demo.tssCluster.default.filtered.bed.gz \
--tssCluster_info_path=./demo/output/sc.solo/filter/demo/log/demo.tssCluster.log.tsv \
--genome=hg19.gencode_v32lift37 \
--outputPrefix=demo \
--outDir=./demo/output/sc.solo/annotate/
```

### Making a custom reference genome
Currently, four reference genomes ara available. See *./script/download.resources.genome* for downloading. Alternatively, some users might work on genomes of other organisms, or prefer to use custom gene models for annotating tCREs.  *tool.cm.prep_genome* converts user-supplied genome *\*.fasta* and gene model *\*.gtf* into necessary files for *SCAFE*. You can check out the help message for inputs of *tool.cm.prep_genome* and then test run a demo using TAIR10 genome with AtRTDv2 gene model.

```shell
#--- check out the help message of tool.cm.prep_genome
./scripts/tool.cm.prep_genome --help

#--- run the tool on the TAIR10 assembly with gene model AtRTDv2 
./scripts/tool.cm.prep_genome \
--overwrite=yes \
--gtf_path=./demo/input/genome/TAIR10.AtRTDv2.gtf.gz \
--fasta_path=./demo/input/genome/TAIR10.genome.fa.gz \
--chrom_list_path=./demo/input/genome/TAIR10.chrom_list.txt \
--mask_bed_path=./demo/input/genome/TAIR10.ATAC.bed.gz \
--outputPrefix=TAIR10.AtRTDv2 \
--outDir=./demo/output/genome/
```
### Run *SCAFE* with bulk CAGE data 
*SCAFE* also accepts *.\*bam* files from bulk CAGE. The major difference between singel cell and bulk workflow is cellbarcode is not considered. Otherwise, the options between single cell and bulk workflow are large the same. Please check the help messages for details of running the workflows: 

```shell
#--- check out the help message of the three single cell workflows
./scripts/workflow.bk.solo --help
./scripts/workflow.bk.pool --help
./scripts/workflow.bk.subsample --help
```
